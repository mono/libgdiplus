	* graphics.c (make_pie): Fix #75475. Use sweepAngle (instead of
	endAngle) when drawing the arcs.

	"The arc always starts at 0. For the fill method the effect is that
	a pie ending at 360 will fill the whole circle..."	

	Patch from Patrick Michel <PBMichel@web.de>.
	
2005-07-01  Jonathan Gilbert  <logic@deltaq.org>

	* bitmap.c: Fixed bug in GdipCreateBitmapFromScan0's default palette
	  initialization. Corrected GdipBitmapGetPixel to permit the operation
	  on indexed bitmaps (uses pixel streams :-).

2005-06-30  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* general.c (ucs2_to_utf8): Added argument to allow specifying the
	  string length (to allow converting substrings)
	* graphics.c (MeasureOrDrawString, MeasureString): Fixed handling
	  of Tabs, now properly advances to the next valid tab stop, if
	  tabs are specified.
	* font.c, image.c: Changed usage of ucs2_to_utf8 to match new prototype
	* gdip.h:
	- Removed TabWidth from GpStringDetailStruct, was obsoleted by
	  tab-redo
	- Changed prototype of ucs2_to_utf8(), added length argument

2005-06-21  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@customerdna.com>

	* graphics.c (GdipCreateFromQuartz_macosx): Set the size of the
	context in the bounds structure.  Fixes #75326

2005-06-13  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* bitmap.c, image.c, gdip.h, bmpcodec.c, jpegcodec.c, tiffcodec.c,
	  gifcodec.c, gifcodec.h, pngcodec.c, pngcodec.h: Re-applied two 
	  previous changes, since #75254 is now fixed

2005-06-13  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Rolled back last two checkins, to r45601, pre palette patch, due
	  to the regression caused with Icons (bug #75254)

2005-06-07  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@customerdna.com>

	* bmpcodec.c: 
	* image.c: Fix some (un)signed mismatch issues so that gdiplus
	will compile on gcc 4.0 again with -Werror

2005-05-30  Jonathan Gilbert  <logic@deltaq.org>

	* bitmap.c: Added indexed pixel formats to
	  gdip_is_a_supported_pixelformat().
	* bitmap.c: Added gdip_is_an_indexed_pixelformat(). Added its
	  prototype to gdip.h; not sure if this is the correct place.
	* bitmap.c: Added support for PixelFormat.Format4bppIndexed to
	  GdipCreateBitmapFromScan0 (maps to CAIRO_FORMAT_A8, like
	  PixelFormat.Format8bppIndexed). Palettes will be created
	  as needed. Bitmaps with a 4bpp indexed pixel format will be
	  given 256-entry ColorPalette structures, as the cairo_format
	  indicates 8-bit data.
	* bitmap.c: GdipCreateBitmapFromScan0 now computes stride for
	  indexed pixel formats differently, and does not convert
	  indexed pixel formats to 32-bit RGB. It also makes images with
	  32-bit pixel formats initially black instead of initially
	  transparent and fills the palette with the default values for
	  1-, 4- and 8-bpp indexed images.
	* bitmap.c: Added support for indexed images to
	  gdip_bitmap_clone_data_rect().
	* bitmap.c: Rewrote GdipBitmapLockBits () to be maintainable
	  while supporting indexed pixel formats. Added
	  gdip_can_window_without_copy (), gdip_is_a_32bit_pixelformat (),
	  gdip_make_alpha_opaque () and gdip_is_an_alpha_pixelformat ().
	* bitmap.c: Moved gdip_from_ARGB_to_RGB () and
	  gdip_from_RGB_to_ARGB () above gdip_bitmap_change_rect_pixel_format (),
	  so that gdip_bitmap_change_rect_pixel_format () can call them.
	* bitmap.c: Added struct StreamingState and methods
	  gdip_init_pixel_stream (), gdip_pixel_stream_has_next (),
	  gdip_pixel_stream_get_next () and gdip_pixel_stream_set_next () to
	  work with Bitmaps of various formats in an abstract way.
	  gdip_pixel_stream_get_next () returns and
	  gdip_pixel_stream_set_next () accepts 32-bit ARGB values for 15,
	  16, 24, 32, 48 and 64 bit formats and palette indices for 1, 4 and
	  8 bit formats. gdip_pixel_stream_get_next () and
	  gdip_pixel_stream_set_next () cannot be mixed; call either one or
	  the other on a given stream, but never both.
	* bitmap.c: Rewrote gdip_bitmap_change_rect_pixel_format to use
	  pixel streams, which adds support for indexed pixel formats and
	  increases maintainability.
	* bitmap.c: Added check to GdipBitmapSetPixel ensuring that
	  the bitmap is not indexed (despite what MSDN says, in
	  practice Microsoft's implementation rejects SetPixel on
	  indexed Bitmaps).
	* bitmap.c: Added gdip_convert_indexed_to_rgb (), which will
	  be used by the functions implementing DrawImage, since
	  gdip_bitmap_ensure_surface () is not compatible with indexed
	  image data.
	* image.c: Added support for indexed pixel formats in
	  GdipDrawImageRect and GdipDrawImageRectRect. The support is
	  for the image being drawn to be indexed, not the image
	  being drawn on. :-)
	* image.c: Implemented GdipGetImagePalette (),
	  GdipSetImagePalette () and GdipGetImagePaletteSize ().
	* bmpcodec.c: Corrected gdip_bitmap_fill_info_header ()'s
	  interpretation of pixel bit widths.
	* bmpcodec.c: Added include directive for gdipImage.h, for
	  utility function gdip_get_pixel_format_bpp ().
	* bmpcodec.c: Updated gdip_bitmap_save_bmp () to save the
	  palette for indexed bitmaps. Also modified the save function
	  to not swap bytes for indexed pixel formats on big-endian
	  architectures.
	* bmpcodec.c: Updated gdip_read_bmp_image_from_file_stream ()
	  to maintain 1, 4 and 8 bpp indexed data instead of converting
	  it on-the-fly to 32 bpp RGB data.
	* bmpcodec.c: Updated gdip_get_pixelformat () to translate
	  a bit width of 1 into Format1bppIndexed.
	* bmpcodec.c: Added support for decoding 4- and 8-bit RLE
	  bitmaps.
	* gifcodec.c: Updated gdip_save_gif_image () to support saving
	  indexed images. Also, an off-by-one error in the 32-bit ARGB
	  side of the encoder was corrected (the image was translated
	  left one pixel).
	* jpegcodec.c: Updated gdip_save_jpeg_image_internal () to
	  reject 8bpp indexed images that are not grayscale (the
	  previous behaviour was to assume all 8bpp indexed images
	  are grayscale).
	* tiffcodec.c: Updated gdip_save_tiff_image () to reject
	  indexed images as NotImplemented, for now at least.
	* pngcodec.c: Updated gdip_load_png_image_from_file_or_stream ()
	  to handle 1-, 4- and 8-bit PNG files separately, without
	  upsampling the data to 32-bit RBG.
	* gdip.h: Fixed the set_pixel_bgra () macro; a lack of
	  parentheses and no cast down to 'unsigned char' was making
	  expressions like set_pixel_bgra (&array[i], ...) fail to
	  compile, and it wasn't a proper statement; it could not be used
	  in a construct like "if (...) set_pixel_bgra(...); else ...;".

2005-05-25  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* graphics.c, font.c, image.c, general.c, gdip.h: Replaced UTF8/UTF16 
	  conversion with UCS2/UTF8 conversion (The MS APIs do not use UTF16)

2005-05-24  Duncan Mak  <duncan@novell.com>

	* graphics-path.c (append_arc): Append PathPointTypeLine instead
	of PathPointTypeStart, so that arcs will be joint properly. This
	fixes bug #75015. Thanks to Elliot Paquette for reporting and
	fixing this bug.

2005-05-24  Duncan Mak  <duncan@novell.com>

	* graphics.c (make_pie, GdipDrawArc): 
	* graphics-path.cs (GdipAddPathArc, GdipAddPathPie): Rewrote the
	code for calculating arcs: instead of drawing two arcs via a
	mid-point, draw multiple arcs at intervals of 90 degrees. This
	results in prettier arcs/pies and a better match to the output
	produced by MS.

2005-05-20  Duncan Mak  <duncan@novell.com>

	* graphics-path.c (GdipAddPathArc): Added a special case for
	drawing ellipses, and remember to use abs() with 'sweepAngle' to
	ensure correctness when the angle is negative.

	This is basically a port of the previous commit.

2005-05-09  Duncan Mak  <duncan@novell.com>

	* graphics.c (make_pie, GdipDrawArc): when evaluating angles,
	always use abs(). This fixes the drawing of arcs and pies when the
	sweep angle is negative.

	Bug #63360 has also been fixed. This was a bug reported by
	Ravindra in August '04 about a hang when "the difference between
	width and height of rectangle is 1 and angles sum is close to
	360". My change doesn't affect this bug. #63360 didn't hang in
	libgdiplus 1.1.7 as is, so it was actually fixed by the Cairo
	guys.

2005-01-14  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* gdip.h: Remove the hdc stuff that was used with wine. Add fields
	for the x display and drawable so that they can be used when

	GdipFillPie. ResetWorldTransform should set the copy_of_ctm
	as well as the graphics->ct matrix to identity.
	Draw/FillPie functions do not do anything, if sweep angle is
	zero deg. This is done to fix the crash that we face when we
	draw/fill pie with zero deg sweep angle. And, some formatting.

	Format32bppRgb pixel formats
	- Fixed GdipBitmapLockBits to return the format and behavior than
	GDI+
	- GetPixel/SetPixel do not work when the bitmap is locked

2004-05-10  Peter Bartok <pbartok@novell.com>
   * gdip_win32.c: Added ObjectList to manage Win32 object that can be
     deleted. Solves problem of asynchronous deletion of object when
     GC kicks in. While we could also use Control.BeginInvoke this method
     allows us to keep private gdip handles away from System.Drawing.
     Currently handles fonts but any other object that could be subject
     to GC should also be managed through the ObjectList code.
   * gdip.h: Added prototype

   * graphics.c: Completely rewrote DrawString and MeasureString:
                 - No longer only works for us-ascii
                 - Now handles multiple sequential linefeeds in DrawString
                 - Now properly calculates the bounding box size
                 - Now handles StringFormat flags (NoWrap, Vertical, Ellipsis)
                 - Now properly breaks lines at whitespace or characters
                 - Now properly handles tabstops
                 - Now properly allows multiple hotkey characters
   * stringformat.c: Changed trimming default to TrimWord (like MS)

	* pen.c: Added assert macros for checking null pointers. Also fixed
	Get/Set/Reset PenTransform functions.
	* graphics.c: Fixed a mistake in Clear function. Cairo takes color
	values in the range [0.0, 1.0], instead of [0, 255].
	* gdip.h: Added return type to gdip_pen_setup function.
	* lineargradientbrush.[ch]: Fixed Get/Set LineTranform functions.

        save it.

2004-04-29  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics-path.c (append): Moved the aforementioned logic into
	here instead; append_point should still just only delegate to
	append.

2004-04-29  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics-path.c (append_point): Add some logic here. Don't
	append a move_to (PathPointTypeStart) if we're already at the
	point we need to be in. This fixes problems we have with filling,
	as Cairo closes all subpaths before a fill op.
	(GdipAddPathLine, GdipAddPathLineI): Removed precaution checks for
	move_to, we're doing it once and for all in append_point.

	This should fix the drawing bug Miguel sees in the GraphicsPath
	in the test form.

2004-04-29  Peter Bartok <pbartok@novell.com>

	* gdip.h: Added flag for multiline strings

	* graphics.cs: Fixed bug #56800, DrawString now handles \n (and

2004-04-26  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* general.c (gdip_open_curve_tangents):
	(gdip_closed_curve_tangents):
	Simplified. Use only one coefficient, instead of a set of
	coefficients per each point on the curve. We now take care of
	tension when calculating tangents.
	(gdip_calculate_coefficients): Removed. Microsoft doesn't use such
	a nice way of calculating coefficients. Their implementation is a
	lot more simplistic.

	Thanks to Professor Rasala for figuring this out.

	* graphics.c (GdipDrawClosedCurve2, GdipDrawCurve3) 
	(GdipFillClosedCurve2): Add tension paramater.

	* graphics-path.c (GdipAddPathCurve3): Implemented.

2004-04-26 Sanjay Gupta <gsanjay@novell.com>
	* image.c: Implemented function GdipGetImageRawFormat.
	* gdip.h: Modifieid GdipImage structure and added ImageFormat 
	enum from gdipImage.h
	* gdipImage.h: Removed ImageFormat enum to gdip.h

2004-04-25  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* graphics.c (GdipCreateFromXDrawable_linux): added method, so that

2004-04-24  Ravindra <rkumar@novell.com>

	* graphics.c: Fixed GdipGraphicsClear() function.
	* gdip.h: Removed some unwanted lines.

2004-04-23  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	oops

	* image.c (GdipDrawImagePoints): implemented.

2004-04-23 Peter Bartok <pbartok@novell.com>

	* bitmap.c (GdipCloneBitmapAreaI): implemented with format
	conversion

	* image.c (GdipDrawImageRect): use gdip_bitmap_ensure_surface
	to create a surface if it's missing.  Fixes 57323

	* bitmap.c (gdip_bitmap_ensure_surface): added as a way to access
	a bitmap image's surface, creating it if it's missing

2004-04-21 Peter Bartok <pbartok@novell.com>
   * font.c: Added private GdipCreateFontFromHfont function to support

	whitespace cleanup, mainly as I touched functions.)

	* gdip.h: Some ARGB access macros, also a cleanup of the PixelFormat
	enum (there is a method to the madness).  Some missing prototypes also.

	* image.c: Got rid of unused gdip_getpixel_formatsize (it can be inferred
	from the pixel format).

	* pathgradientbrush.c: Sets the cairo rgb color to the center color of the
	gradient.  Not pretty, but better than nothing.
	
	* Makefile.am: Added -Wall -Wno-unused -Wno-format.  Lots of
	functions that should have been returning values weren't,
	functions used without prototypes, etc.  Touched files to fix
	missing return issues: bmpcodec.c, brush.h, font.c, gdip_win32.h,
	general.c, graphics.c, hatchbrush.c, imageattributes.c,

2004-04-19 Sanjay Gupta <gsanjay@novell.com>

2004-04-15 Ravindra  <rkumar@novell.com>

	* texturebrush.h: Moved internal functions to texturebrush.c.
	* texturebrush.c: Few fixes to handle scale/rotate functions. But,
	we still don't get scaling/rotation right. Seems to be some problem
	with Cairo. Checking in code now, will see this later when I'm sure
	that Cairo is doing right.

2004-04-14 Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

        * bitmap.c -  fixes biXPelsPerMeter fields

	* bmpcodec.c -  fixes strides, fixes new WinNT BMP headers,
        support for OS/2 bitmaps, 8 and 24 bits, upside bitmaps, gets
        different pixelformats correct loading/saving, reformatted to 8
        tabs, support for load/save palette if present (RGBTRIPLE and
        SQUADS), fixes bitmap writting to allow to work with more tools
        (saving it upside down), etc.

2004-04-14  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics-path.c (GdipAddPathLine, GdipAddPathLineI): Only append
	a starting point if the current point is not the same as the point
	we're appending. This removes unnecessary subpaths, and fixes
	GdipFillPath.

2004-04-13  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* jpegcodec.c (gdip_save_jpeg_image_internal): Check for pixformat
	equal to Format24bppRgb, not 32bpp when deciding whether to do
	argb conversion.  Fixes #56967.

	* texturebrush.h: Moved WrapMode enum to gdip.h, to share
	it with the pgbrush
	
	* general.c (gdip_rect_expand_by): Helper function to
	build bounding rects

	* gdip.h: Bunch of new prototypes
	
	* pathgradientbrush.c: Stub implementations of this.  Real version
	will probably require me to add gouraud triangle shading to cairo,
	which will happen Real Soon Now.

2004-04-12  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* gdip.h, image.c: I misread the *I methods.  Implement
	them correctly, keeping the corrent int/float distinction.
	Also added a bunch of GdipDrawImage* stubs.

2004-04-11  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* general.c (GdiplusStartup): I really meant $GDIPLUS_NOX
	to mean "no X" instead of "require X".

	* texturebrush.c, image.c: Use gdip_cairo_set_surface_pattern

	* general.c: (gdip_cairo_set_surface_pattern) helper function
	to create a new pattern from a surface and set it.
	(GdiplusStartup): Don't acquire an X display if GDIPLUS_NOX is set
	(gdip_get_display_dpi): use GDIP_display instead of creating a new
	XDisplay

2004-04-10  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* gdip.h, graphics.c: Added lots of Get/Set stuffs.

2004-04-12  Ravindra  <rkumar@novell.com>

	* texturebrush.h: Internal functions should not appear here. 
	Removed internal functions. Uncommented few implemented functions.
	* texturebrush.c: Moved around few functions as per the change
	in header file.

2004-04-11  Peter Bartok <pbartok@novell.com>
   * gdip_win32.c: Added fontsize translation when creating HFONT
   * font.c: Added private function to retrieve the HFONT handle

2004-04-10  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* image.c (GdipDrawImageRectI): put back version that handles
	scaling correctly and doesn't create an extra graphics context
	unnecessarily.

	* graphics.c (gdip_graphics_attach_bitmap): set the surface on a
	GpBitmap after setting it as the cairo target; each GpBitmap
	should always have an associated cairo surface. (fixes #56803)

	* image.c (gdip_image_init): can't call get_display_dpi(), because
	we might not have an X display at all.

2004-04-10 Peter Bartok <pbartok@novell.com>
   * bitmap.c: Removed the hack that set the Win32 bitmap to white.
     Instead it now simulates alpha blending and merges the Win32
     bitmap onto the cairo image surface. This makes drawing between
     cairo and Wine/Win32 fully compatible, albeit with two 
     drawbacks: First, the copying of the bitmap is done pixel by
     pixel, and second, the color value of UNALTERED_PIXEL in
     a Win32 bitmap will be treated as transparent.

   * image.c: Removed the 'improved' GdipDrawImageRectI function. I lost a
     whole day tracking down why SWF stopped working. The 'improved'
     version doesn't seem to work (yet). Left the broken version
     with an #if 0 for future fixing.

   * gdip_win32.c: Added functions to create/delete HFONT handles tracking
     the cairo fonts.

   * gdip_win32.h: Added prototypes

   * font.c: Now also creates/deletes Wine font tracking the cairo font

   * gdip.h: Added HFONT element to GpFont structure

2004-04-10  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics.c (GdipDrawCurve):
	(GdipDrawClosedCurve, GdipFillClosedCurve): Added all the
	overloads, properly delegate the work to avoid code
	duplication. Handle the case when tension = 0; in that case, we
	draw/fill a polygon for closed curves, and just draw straight
	lines for open curves.
	(GdipDrawCurve3): Fixed signature, there was a missing offset
	argument.

	* gdip.h: Added open and closed curve drawing and filling
	functions.

2004-04-10  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>	

	* general.c (gdip_open_curve_tangents): Fixed some more errors in
	the porting of the algorithm. We should be passing Z to
	gdip_calculate_coefficients instead of count. Z = 2 * count - 1.

2004-04-10  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>	

	* graphics.c (GdipDrawCurve): Doh! Use the ask for tangents for
	open curves, not closed curves.

	* graphics-path.c (GdipResetPath): Don't set them to NULL. That
	wouldn't work, doofus.

	* graphics.c (GdipDrawCurve2I): Fixed function signature and use
	convert_points to  pass the work onto GdipDrawCurve2.
	(GdipDrawCurve3I): Fixed function signature.

	* general.c (gdip_open_curve_tangents): Fix typo.

2004-04-09 Peter Bartok <pbartok@novell.com>
   * Makefile.am: Added region.c to list of sourcefiles

2004-04-09 Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>
	* region.c - fixes to regions 

2004-04-09  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics-path.c (append_curve): Moved it to the top along with
	the other append helper functions.
	(GdipAddPathCurve, GdipAddPathCurveI): Implemented using
	gdip_open_curve_tangents.
	(GdipAddString): Fixed signature.

	* general.c (gdip_open_curve_tangents): Implemented.o
	(gdip_closed_curve_tangents): Fixed memory leak here.

	* gdip.h (gdip_open_curve_tangents): Add here. To be shared
	between graphics.c and graphics-path.c.

2004-04-08 Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>
	* region.c - Started regions implementation
        * gdip.h - signature changes

2004-04-07  Ravindra  <rkumar@novell.com>

	* texturebrush.[ch]: Added the missing functionality of clipping
	a rectangle out of image provided.

2004-04-06  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* jpegcodec.c (gdip_save_jpeg_image_internal): 
	remove stray JCS_GRAYSCALE setting, which was generating
	very bizzare images.
	
	* jpegcodec.c, pngcodec.c: Allow reading/writing non-RGBA data.
	The GpBitmap.data struct holds cairo-compatible data (always 32bpp
	RGBA), whereas the GpImage.pixFormat field holds what this data is
	actually supposed to be (i.e. grayscale).  Still no support for
	colormapped images.

2004-04-07  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics.c (make_pie): Retort to make_ellipse *after* drawing
	the line.

2004-04-06  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* jpegcodec.c (gdip_save_jpeg_image_internal): implement
	jpeg saving, both files and streams.  Format options are
	ignored for now.

	* image.c (GdipSaveImageToFile,
	(GdipSaveImageToDelegate_linux): add JPEG

	* image.c (gdip_get_pixel_format_components): added function

	* jpegcodec.c (gdip_load_jpeg_image_internal): add missing
	jpeg_destroy_decompress()

2004-04-06  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics.c (make_arc): Just follow what I did with GraphicsPath
	and use a boolean flag instead of doing FP comparison. It's not
	worth it.

2004-04-06  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* gdip.h: Added stream handling delegate prototypes,
	and some missing function protos

	* gdipImage.h: stream delegate loading/saving functions

	* image.c: stream loading/saving bits, implemented
	via linux-specific delegates.  Added guids for various
	file formats, and a gdip_image_format_for_clsid()
	helper function

	* jpegcodec.c: supports reading from a stream

	* pngcodec.c: supports writing; also supports
	reading/writing with a stream

	* image.c: blit surface directly for painting images,
	instead of creating a graphics context for it first

	* gifcodec.c, jpegcodec.c, pngcodec.c, tifcodec.c:
	Write data with the correct flags and resolution bits,
	to (almost) match what win32 outputs

2004-04-04  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* gifcodec.c, tiffcodec.c, pngcodec.c: include config.h, which
	actually enables this code.. so that the glaring bugs as a result
	of it never having been compiled before can be fixed. *cough*

	* image.c (GdipDrawImageRectI): do correct scaling
	if source and dest width/height don't match.
	(GdipLoadImageFromFile): fseek back to the start
	before passing to the loader.

2004-04-04  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* image.c: Changed loader calls to use correct
	load prototypes

	* pngcodec.c, gifcodec.c: Implemented png and gif loading

	* gdip.h: Changed ColorPalette to match GDI+; Entries is part
	of the allocated struct, not a separate pointer.  Also
	added some ARGB convenience macros.

	* bmpcodec.c, bmpcodec.h: Updated load prototypes to match
	usage

2004-04-04  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@pobox.com>

	* src/image.c, src/gdip.h: Added GdipDrawImage/DrawImageRect

	* src/jpegcodec.c, src/tiffcodec.c: Implemented loading jpeg and
	tiff images.  Need to test these out on windows, to see exactly
	what formats stuff gets retruned in, but I think we should be ok
	for the most common cases.  No file saving yet.
	
	* src/bmpcodec.c, src/gifcodec.c, src/pngcodec.c:
	Remove calls to bogus (and undefined) gdip_image_new()

2004-04-04  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics.c (make_curve): Renamed from
	gdip_make_closed_curve. Added a new _CurveType argument.
	(convert_points): Moved to general.c, as it's used in
	graphics-path.c as well.

	* graphics-path.c (append_curve): Add a _CurveType
	argument. Renamed from gdip_append_closed_curve for consistency.
	(GdipAddPathClosedCurve2I): Hook it up.

	* general.c (convert_points): Moved here from graphics.c
	(gdip_open_curve_tangents): Declare here. No code yet, need to
	investigate end tangents.

	* gdip.h (_CurveType): New (private) enum for distinguishing open
	and close curves.

2004-04-04  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>	

	* graphics-path.c (append_arc): Added a new boolean argument. to
	determine if we're continuing an existing curve.

2004-04-04  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>	

	* graphics.c (make_arc): Only call move_to when we're not already at
	that point. This fixes FillPie, as cairo_fill implicitly closes
	all subpaths before filling. The extraneous move_to call earlier
	was causing Cairo to close early.
	(make_pie): Removed the debug messages.	

2004-04-02  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics.c (make_pie, GdipDrawArc): If the delta is greater than
	or equal to 360 degrees, then we're effectively drawing an
	ellipse, so make it do so.

2004-04-02  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics.c (GdipFillPieI, GdipDrawPieI): Instead of having
	another copy of the code, just use the float equivalent.
	(GdipDrawPie): Add restore/save pair.
	(make_pie): This is broken right now. Added some debugging
	messages.

2004-04-01  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics.c (GdipFillClosedCurve, GdipFillClosedCurveI):
	Implemented.

2004-04-02  Ravindra <rkumar@novell.com>
	* texturebrush.c: Implemented TileFlipXY wrapmode.

2004-04-01  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics.c (convert_points): New helper function to turn a list
	of GpPoints into GpPointFs.
	(GdipDrawClosedCurveI): Implemented using convert_points, then
	just call GdipDrawClosedCurve.

2004-04-01  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>	

	Implemented drawing ClosedCurves in Graphics and GraphicsPath. 

	These functions are implemented with the help of Prof. Rasala at
	Northeastern University. The algorithm is described in:

	     Richard Rasala, Explicit Cubic Spline Interpolation Formulas,
	     in Andrew S. Glassner, Graphics Gems, Academic Press, 1990,
	     579-584.

	Remaining TODO: Finish open curves and consider tension.
	
	* graphics.c (gdip_make_closed_curve): Translates vertices
	and tangents for cairo_curve_to.
	(GdipDrawClosedCurve): Implemented.

	* graphics-path.c (gdip_append_closed_curve): Translates vertices
	and tangents into append_bezier.
	(GdipAddPathClosedCurve2): Implemented.

2004-04-01  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>	

	* gdip.h: Added the new functions for calculating tangents.
	(CURVE_MIN_TERMS, CURVE_MAX_TERMS): Constants used in tangent
	calculations.

	* general.c (gdip_calculate_coefficients) 
	(gdip_closed_curve_tangents): Two helper functions for drawing
	closed curves.

2004-03-30  Sanjay Gupta <gsanjay@novell.com>
	*pngcodec.c Implemented one more method.
	*gdip.h Modified ColorPalette structure.

2004-03-31  Sachin Kumar <skumar1@novell.com>
	* Makefile.am: Updated file to make it work for
	  'make distcheck'.

2004-03-30 Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>
	* image.c - GdipGetImageBounds and fixes
        * bitmap.c - keep the witdh, height and pixel format in sync with the image struct

2004-03-30  Sanjay Gupta <gsanjay@novell.com>
	*pngcodec.c Added crc check
	*pngcodec.h Added crc check

2004-03-28  Sanjay Gupta <gsanjay@novell.com>
	* pngcodec.c implementing png encoder
	* pngcodec.h implementing png encoder

2004-03-26  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics.c: Prepare for the Curve and CloseCurve work by
	stubbing out some functions.

	* graphics.c (gdip_plot_path): Fixed the handling of paths
	containing PathPointTypeBezier points. Previously, we were
	resetting the index to zero at the head of each loop, so we were
	never drawing Bezier curves correctly. Also, we need to draw the
	curve immediately once we've stored 3 points, instead of waiting
	till the next iteration (which may never come). This is an
	off-by-one error.

	* graphics-path.c (append_arc): Use floats instead of ints to hold
	the center points, use doubles to hold the trig points.

2004-03-26 Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>
	* image.c - dpis and parameter checking

2004-03-26  Ravindra  <rkumar@novell.com>
	* texturebrush.c: Implemented TileFlipY wrapmode and fixed
	TileFlipX wrapmode.

2004-03-26  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* graphics-path.c: Port the changes made to graphics here.
	(append_arc): New function, modeled after make_arc for appending
	arcs (a set of Bezier points) to the Path.
	(GdipAddPathArc): Calculate the middle angle correctly and call
	append_arc.
	(GdipAddPathPie): Removed duplication, call append_arc
	appropriately.

2004-03-26  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>
	
	* graphics.c (make_arc): Use the end angle instead of the sweep
	angle.  Previously, the code was misbehaving because I used the
	sweep angle as the end angle.
	(make_pie, DrawArc): Determine the middle angle correctly in cases
	where the delta > 180. Even though this sounds simple, it took a
	long time for me to figure out.
	(make_pie): Simplifed things a bit. Instead of replicating most of
	the arc-drawing algorithm here, use of make_arc instead. This reduced
	some of the duplicates in the code.
	(DrawArcI): I'm tired on maintaining so many copies of the same
	code, so just call DrawArc now.

	With this patch, we should be drawing Arcs and Pies correctly.
	
2004-03-25  Ravindra <rkumar@novell.com>
	* texturebrush.[ch]: Fixing texture brush. Still needs
	some work.

2004-03-24  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	have Brush and BrushClass (vtable) structs defined here 
	and related functions are declared.
	* solidbrush.h: Added. For implementing brushes in OO-C,
	we have SolidBrush struct defined here. Also, solid brush
	functions are declared.
	* gdip.h: Moved out brush functions to brush.h and solidbrush
	functions to solidbrush.h. Also, moved GpStatus enum and 
	GpGraphics struct to brush.h. (This is just to satisfy 
	compiler).
	* brush.c: All functions are modified to call functions from
	vtable.
	* solidbrush.c: new(), init(), setup(), clone() and destroy()
	functions are modified.
	* pen.c: gdip_pen_setup(): Modified to call gdip_brush_setup
	irrespective of brush type.
		GdipCreatePen2(): Added status checks. Now we set color
	also when SolidBrush is in the question. This applies to 
	GdipSetPenBrushFill() method also.
	* stringformat.c: Renaming method gdip_brush_init to
	gdip_stringformat_init. Because the method name is used
	in brush.c.

    * fonts.c fixed re-use of the same font, fixed size problems
    * graphics.c - string format, aligment, etc
    * stringformat.c - initial implementation

2004-02-05  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* gdip.h (GpRect, GpRectF): Instead of storing coordinates in
	terms of top, left, right, bottom, changed it to use X, Y, Width
	and Height instead. This matches the requirements for GDI+ (Flat
	API and the C++ wrapper) as well as System.Drawing.

	* bitmap.c (GdipBitmapLockBits): 
	* matrix.c (GdipCreateMatrix3, GdipCreateMatrix3I):

2004-01-26  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>	

	* graphics.c (GdipDrawPath): Doh! Added stupid breaks inside the

	* bitmap.c:
	(GdipCreateBitmapFromScan0): Set allocate memory for scan0 if it
	is NULL. Thanks to Jordi for fixing this, we can now write out to

	hook up the GraphicsPath code and work on testing and making sure
	this stuff is correct. I'm pretty sure, in a first pass, there are
	lots of littles bugs waiting to be fixed.

	* graphics-path.c (new_point): Removed, we now pack the point
	inside the append functions.
	(append): New function that takes the X, Y coordinates directly.
