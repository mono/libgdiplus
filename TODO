GdipBeginContainer2
GdipBeginContainerI
GdipGetPixelOffsetMode		[2]
GdipGetTextContrast		[2]
GdipSetPixelOffsetMode		[2]
GdipSetTextContrast		[2]
GdipTransformPoints
GdipTransformPointsI

* Image handling

GdipSetImageAttributesThreshold
GdipSetImageAttributesOutputChannelColorProfile
GdipGetImageAttributesAdjustedPalette
GdipSetImageAttributesOutputChannel
GdipLoadImageFromStream
GdipSaveImageToStream
GdipSaveAdd
GdipSaveAddImage 

* Functions related to paths

GdipAddString			[1]
GdipAddStringI			[1]
GdipWindingModeOutline
GdipWidenPath
GdipWarpPath

---- Known Limitations

* Maximum of 32bpp

	GDI+ supports bitmaps with more than 32bpp.

* Coordinates limitations

	GDI+ supports 32bips of precision (Cairo is limited to 15bits)

* Cairo doesn't support 8-bit pseudocolor visuals

	http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=77937

* Cairo doesn't implement cairo_stroke_to_path

	GdipWidenPath implementation depends on this feature.
