/* This macro marks a symbol as STV_HIDDEN, which prevents it from being
   added to the dynamic symbol table of the shared library.  This prevents
   users of the library from knowingly or unknowingly accessing library
   internals that may change in future releases.  It also allows the 
   compiler to generate slightly more efficient code in some cases.

   The macro should be placed either immediately before the return type in
   a function declaration:

	pixman_private int
	somefunction(void);

   or after a data name,

	extern int somedata pixman_private;

   The ELF visibility attribute did not exist before gcc 3.3.  */
/* ??? Not marked with "slim" because that makes it look too much
   like the function name instead of just an attribute.  */

#if (__GNUC__ > 3 || (__GNUC__ == 3 && __GNUC_MINOR__ >= 3)) && defined(__ELF__)
#define pixman_private	__attribute__((__visibility__("hidden")))

/* The following macros are used for PLT bypassing.  First of all,
   you need to have the function prototyped somewhere, say in foo.h:

	int foo (int __bar);

   If calls to foo within libfoo.so should always go to foo defined
   in libfoo.so, then in fooint.h you add:

	slim_hidden_proto (foo)

   and after the foo function definition:

	int foo (int __bar)
	{
	  return __bar;
	}
	slim_hidden_def (foo);

   This works by arranging for the C symbol "foo" to be renamed to
   "INT_foo" at the assembly level, which is marked pixman_private.
   We then create another symbol at the same address (an alias) with
   the C symbol "EXT_foo", which is renamed to "foo" at the assembly
   level.  */
