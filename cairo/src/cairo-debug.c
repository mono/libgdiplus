/**
 * cairo_debug_reset_static_data:
 * 
 * Resets all static data within cairo to its original state,
 * (ie. identical to the state at the time of program invocation). For
 * example, all caches within cairo will be flushed empty.
 *
 * This function is intended to be useful when using memory-checking
 * tools such as valgrind. When valgrind's memcheck analyzes a
 * cairo-using program without a call to cairo_debug_reset_static_data,
 * it will report all data reachable via cairo's static objects as
 * "still reachable". Calling cairo_debug_reset_static_data just prior
 * to program termination will make it easier to get squeaky clean
 * reports from valgrind.
 *
 * WARNING: It is only safe to call this function when there are no
 * active cairo objects remaining, (ie. the appropriate destroy
 * functions have been called as necessary). If there are active cairo
 * objects, this call is likely to cause a crash, (eg. an assertion
 * failure due to a hash table being destroyed when non-empty).
