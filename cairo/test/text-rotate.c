 *	Subject: [cairo] Rotated text bug on drawable target
 *
 * 	The attached file draws text rotated 90 degrees first to a PNG file and
 *	then to a drawable. The PNG file looks fine, the text on the drawable is
 *	unreadable.

 *
 *   Looks like the major problems with this bg appeared in the great
 *   font rework between 0.1.23 and 0.2.0. And it looks like we need
 *   to fix the regression test suite to test the xlib target (since
 *   the bug does not show up in the png backend).
 *
 *   Hmm... Actually, things don't look perfect even in the PNG
 *   output. Look at how that 'o' moves around. It's particularly off
 *   in the case where it's rotated by PI.
 *
 *   And I'm still not sure about what to do for test cases with
 *   text--a new version of freetype will change everything. We may
 *   need to add a simple backend for stroked fonts and add a simple
 *   builtin font to cairo for pixel-perfect tests with text.
