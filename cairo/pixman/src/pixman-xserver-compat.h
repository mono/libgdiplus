/* This is a compatibility header file, designed to make it easier to
 * synchronize files between libpixman and the xserver repository.
 *
 * Of course, long-term we would instead like to have the X server
 * depend on libpixman to eliminate the code duplication. But for now,
 * we at least make it easy to share files.
 *
 * The libpixman code base regards the xserver repository as canonical
 * for any shared files, so changes should be pushed up there. Then,
 * to merge changes back down into libpixman, the process should be to
 * simply copy the file and to replace the block of include directives
 * with:
 *
 *	#include "pixman-xserver-compat.h"
 */

/* First, include the primary internal header file for libpixman. */

#include "icint.h"

/* Then, define any names that the server code will be expecting in
