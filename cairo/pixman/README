libpixman - Pixel manipulation library

libpixman is a merge of libpixregion and libic.
It also includes the slim headers.

libpixregion - Pixel region Library

libpixregion is a generic library for manipulating pixel regions. A
PixRegion is a set of Y-X banded rectangles that cover the desired
region.

The original code for libxregion was part of the reference X server
implementation of the X Window System. A modified copy of the code
also exists in the Xlib client library. libpixregion was formed so
that both the X server and client libraries could share common code
for region manipulation.

libpixregion is also intended to be applicable outside of the X Window
System. The public interface of libpixregion does not depend on any
part of the X Window System.

libic - Image compositing library

libic is a generic image compositing library. libic provides
Porter/Duff compositing of images and implicit mask generation for
geometric primitives including trapezoids, triangles, and rectangles.

The semantics of libic are designed to precisely match the
specification of the X Render extension. In fact, the initial
implementation of libic was lifted from the reference implementation
of RENDER from the X server.

However, libic is intended to be useful independent of the X Window
System. The public interface exported by libic does not contain any
X-specific data structures.

Keith Packard (keithp@keithp.com) originally wrote all the original
RENDER code that was yanked out to become libic. Keith also provided
impetus and guidance in the development of libic.
